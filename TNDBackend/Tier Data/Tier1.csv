Conference Presentations and Proceedings,N/A,One conference: Conference to Tennessee Association of Utility Districts (TAUD) on Wastewater Plant Optimization [March 2021].,"Two conferences: Tennessee Stormwater Association Conference [October 2023], and TN Show of the South Conference [May 11, 2022].",One conference: Southern Division American Fisheries Society Meeting.,"Two conferences: KY/TN Water Quality Professionals [November 16, 2023], and West TN Water Resources Symposium [February 2023].",
Task Force Meetings,"5 meetings in 2021, 6 meetings in 2022, and 1 meeting in 2023.","5 meetings in 2021, 6 meetings in 2022, a meeting in October 2023 (5 attendees), and a meeting in November 2023 (5 attendees).","5 meetings in 2021, 6 meetings in 2022, and a meeting in October 2023 (6 attendees).","Initial group formation on November 6, 2023 (10 attendees).","Meetings on June 24, 2021, September 30, 2021, December 9, 2021, March 10, 2021, June 9, 2022, September 8, 2022, April 5, 2023 (25 attendees), and December 6, 2023 (23 attendees).",
Case Studies and Success Stories,"There were two case studies. First was the 2023 TDA Nutrient Management Survey of TN. An online survey of producers in Tennessee was conducted in February and March of 2023 to better understand their use of, and objectives with, nutrient management practices such as nutrient management planning, soil testing, cover crops, no-till, and variable rate application, among other practices. The other was the USDA - NRCS’s Corn-Silk-Farms Case-Study. This case study shows the economic benefits of soil health practices after nine years, and data in 2021 was collected to show the economic effects of soil health practices on Corn Silk Family Farms LLC.","There were three TNPOP case studies. The first was Oneida and McMinnville. The TDEC staff worked with four TN municipal wastewater treatment facility owners to optimize nutrient removal and energy usage at their treatment facilities. Technical training, data review, in-plant visits, and remote support were provided. The two facilities that remained engaged throughout the process – Oneida and McMinnville – realized measurable improvements. The other was the Cookeville study, where TDEC’s Wastewater Nutrient Plant Optimization Project aimed for cost savings, removal nitrogen and phosphorus prior to discharge to surface waters, reduce electricity consumption, and production of less sludge. Finally, there is the Norris study, where the Norris Water Commission took the initiative to learn and pursue innovative low-cost approaches to optimizing water quality and reducing energy consumption through voluntary participation in TDEC’s Wastewater Nutrient Plant Optimization Project.",N/A,"There was one case study, which was the US COE’s Hatchie-Loosahatchie Mississippi River Ecosystem Restoration Study. This three-year study was conducted to examine and address problems, opportunities, and solution-viability associated with Mississippi River ecosystem degradation along the Hatchie-Loosahatchie River reach, miles 775-736.",N/A,
Research and Publications,There was one publication: The Nature Conservancy’s Farming for the Future; Cover Crops: Trends & Next Steps for Tennessee. This publication provides information specific to Tennessee to help local farmers and the greater community better understand how increased adoption of cover crops specifically would serve to better sustain agricultural and environmental well-being across the state and beyond.,N/A,N/A,"There was one publication: Nutrient and algal responses to a managed drawdown in an agricultural riverine lake. Water level of a shallow impounded riverine lake was lowered to help improve downstream flows and water quality within the Big Sunflower River in the agriculturally dominated Mississippi Delta, Mississippi, USA. A study was conducted to better understand how nutrient and algal processes within shallow lakes respond to relatively rapid water level changes to guide water resource management decisions.",N/A,
Reports and Maps,"There was one report, which was the 2023 Tennessee Nutrient Management Report. This report was written with the 2023 TDA Nutrient Management Survey of TN. An online survey of producers in Tennessee was conducted in February and March of 2023 to better understand their use of, and objectives with, nutrient management practices such as nutrient management planning, soil testing, cover crops, no-till, and variable rate application, among other practices.",N/A,"There was one report, which was the EPA Region 4 Urban BPM literature review. In support of the Tennessee Nutrient Task Force BMP working group, EPA HQ and Region 4 provided contract work to compile a comprehensive inventory of scientific literature for urban stormwater BMPs from the Southeast Region of the United States. This literature review includes summaries of loading and removal efficiencies for nutrients, sediment, and other common pollutants, and a summary of the crediting practices and protocols, if any, used in the study area. ",N/A,"There were two reports. The first was the 2021 Inaugural TN Nutrient Task Force Report. Tennessee is one of 12 states with a nutrient contribution to the Mississippi River, with an estimate of 5% of the nitrogen and 5% of the phosphorus being contributed by TN sources. This report demonstrates TDEC and TDA’s efforts in managing the nutrient inputs to our rivers, lakes, and streams. The other report is the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force 2023 Report to Congress. This report is an important tool for describing the HTF’s progress toward reducing nutrient loads to the northern Gulf, amplifying state summaries of progress, sharing lessons learned in implementing nutrient reduction strategies, and adaptively managing strategies for improving water quality in the Gulf.",
